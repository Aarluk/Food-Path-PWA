# Food Path App

## Overview
Implement an application for planning a food-centric trip as a PWA (progressive web app) that allows users to filter their desired food experience based on budget, location, and dietary considerations. The main focus will be an interactive app showing an itinerary of eateries that the user can save.

## MVP
The PWA should support logged in users. Users should be able to fill out a form with their itinerary preferences and be able to interact with a provided map and list of the selected restaurants. Users should also be able to click on a specific restaurant and be taken to a detail page for that restaurant. Users will be able to save their itinerary and view any saved itineraries offline.

## Stretch Goals
Ensure our app is widely accessible to a broad demographic of users:
  - support languages other than English & allow users to choose their preferred language when creating an account
  - tag features to work with voice control systems
  - all images include alt text in the codebase

Incorporate extra features into a user's profile such as:
  - share their itinerary
  - favorite or rate saved itineraries
  - favorite or rate single restaurants from an itinerary

Incorporate extra features into the initial itinerary creation & view such as:
  - switch out a single restaurant from a provided itinerary
  - make a reservation through the app for a single restaurant
  - enable a "near me" feature that allows for more specific location restrictions (ie. zipcode)

## Technical Challenges
- Mobile development
- Filtering the suggested list of restaurants based on ratings
- Building a database of restaurants with all desired information (especially dietary considerations)
- Connecting with external APIs (Yelp, Google, Instagram)
